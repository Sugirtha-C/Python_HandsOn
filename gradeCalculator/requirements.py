Multi-Student Grade Calculator
Objective
Create a Python program that handles multiple students,
stores their scores in a list of dictionaries, calculates their final grades, and determines if they have passed or failed.
Instructions
Input:
Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains
the name of a student and their scores in five subjects: Math, Science, English, History, and Art.
Ensure the scores are between 0 and 100.
Processing:
Write a function to calculate the average score for each student.
Write a function to determine the final grade based on the average score:
90-100: Grade A
80-89: Grade B
70-79: Grade C
60-69: Grade D
Below 60: Grade F
Write a function to determine if the student has passed or failed. A student passes if their final grade is D or above.
Output:
Print each studentâ€™s name, average score, final grade, and whether they passed or failed.
Steps
Define the calculate_average_score(student) function to calculate the average score.
Define the determine_grade(average_score) function to determine the final grade.
Define the determine_pass_fail(final_grade) function to determine if the student passed or failed.
Iterate through the list of students, calculate their grades and results, and print the outcomes.
